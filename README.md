VPC and Subnet Configuration with Pulumi
This project demonstrates the use of Pulumi to create an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and associated subnets with custom IP address blocks.

Prerequisites
Pulumi installed and configured
AWS CLI configured with your AWS credentials
Getting Started
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure the project using Pulumi CLI. Replace your-VPC-CIDR and your-destination-CIDR with your desired values.

bash
Copy code
pulumi config set app:VPCCidrBlock your-VPC-CIDR
pulumi config set app:destinationCidrBlock your-destination-CIDR
Run the Pulumi program to create the VPC and subnets:

bash
Copy code
pulumi up
After the program completes, you will see the AWS resources created based on your configuration.

Configuration
You can configure the VPC's CIDR block and the destination CIDR block using the Pulumi configuration:

app:VPCCidrBlock: The desired VPC CIDR block.
app:destinationCidrBlock: The destination CIDR block.
Customizing Subnet IP Blocks
The subnets' IP addresses are calculated based on the VPC's CIDR block. You can customize the IP block format by modifying the ipPart1 and ipPart2 values in the code. Ensure that the custom IP blocks do not overlap or conflict with the VPC CIDR block.

Important Notes
The code is intended for educational purposes and may require further customization for production use.
